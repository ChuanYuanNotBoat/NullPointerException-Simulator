# ☠️ NullPointerException Simulator  
> *Because if you haven't met it, you're not a real developer.*

---

## 💥 Overview
**NullPointerException Simulator** is a totally unnecessary yet emotionally accurate terminal experience.  
It simulates the *pure existential dread* of seeing `java.lang.NullPointerException` appear out of nowhere —  
now with **randomized stack traces**, **fake reflection calls**, **optional sound effects**, and **flashing terminal panic**.

Perfect for:
- Scaring your friends who code in Java ☕  
- Reminding yourself why you switched languages  
- Teaching beginners what true debugging despair feels like  

---

## 🧩 Features
✅ Realistic fake stack traces  
✅ Randomized call chains (like a real JVM chaos machine)  
✅ Occasionally throws “Caused by” just to keep you guessing  
✅ Optional audio support (because silence is mercy)  
✅ Cross-platform terminal meltdown support  
✅ 0% useful, 100% emotionally accurate

## 🧠 Technical Notes
This script:
- Detects your terminal width and dynamically centers chaos.  
- Supports `pygame`, `mpv`, `mplayer`, or `ffplay` for audio playback.  
- Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and even Termux.  
- Cleans up after itself... eventually.  

You don’t need Java.  
You just need **pain**.

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
python3 bug.py
```

(Optionally place a dramatic audio file like `audio.mp3` beside it for full immersion.)

## 🪦 Example Output
```
java.lang.NullPointerException
    at com.example.DataProcessor.validateInput(DataProcessor.java:27)
    at com.example.ValidationUtil.checkNotNull(ValidationUtil.java:18)
    at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
Possible Cause: Null check failed - parameter was null
```
*(You can almost smell the burnt caffeine.)*
